The TeamPlatinumViewer is an application to search for and display a single student's academic record from a structured data file containing an arbitrary amount of students and courses.

Our project currently depends on DataContractSerializer to deserialize the xml file that we expect from "the client" in this scenario.
At that point, we create our object models to match the structure of the XML document and deserialize from there.

Our project currently utilizes the an XML file generated from a secondary project created by iFialAtFail and is hosted on the Ferris-DMSE
github at the following url: https://github.com/Ferris-DMSE/StudentDataXMLGenerator.
