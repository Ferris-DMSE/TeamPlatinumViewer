# TeamPlatinumViewer
Team Platinum's homework for SCM, The Viewer

This branch contains a quick working prototype for the XML deserializer and shows the framework needed to get usable data from a structured XML document. The document that it can currently parse is provided with the package and is based off of the first working Student Data generator on a sister project hosted at Ferris-DMSE github called the StudentDataXMLGenerator.
